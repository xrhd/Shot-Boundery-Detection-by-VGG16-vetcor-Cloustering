[ Sample video here!](https://youtu.be/ffyKY3Dj5ZE) 

## 1. Extract frames from fideo...

* OpenCV

## 2. Extract features from frames...

* VGG16

## 3. Cluster frames by feature arrays into scene classes...

* Kmeans
    or
* DBSCAN

## 4. Find the most frequently shown scene class...

* Just Counting

## 5. Choose the middle frame from main scene class...
